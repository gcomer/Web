      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>My name is Gabriel Austin Comer, and I am a senior undergraduate student of Computer Science at the University of Texas at Arlington. My expected graduation date is May 2019, and I am currently seeking a career in software development. This website is intended to host the latest version of my résumé, as well as demos and information on some of my latest projects.</p>

      <h4>Technical Skills</h4>
      <p>I am proficient in several programming languages, including Python, Java, C++, and Javascript. I also have experience with several other programming languages, including C, Perl, and C#. Currently the only markup language I am proficient with is HTML5, though I have limited experience with LaTeX.</p>
      <p>My coursework at The University of Texas at Arlington has been varied in content, however in my last few semesters I have focused my curriculum on computer vision and computer graphics.
      <p><b>Computer vision</b> is an incredibly exciting field, and has boundless potential for applications in industry. I am eager to find those applications, and continue to learn as the technology grows and improves. My <a href="senior_design.html">senior design</a> project utilizes computer vision to analyze a Jenga&trade; tower, and I am working on a side project that uses template matching to count coins.</p>
      <p>Programming <b>computer graphics</b> is incredibly fun, and the most engaging application of mathematics I know of. Take a look at my <a href="/bezier_curve.html">Bézier curve</a></li> and <a href="/bezier_patch.html">Bézier patch</a> demos to see what I mean. Last semester my graphics class created a simple wireframe renderer in python that was capable of performing parallel and perspective projections, with Euler rotations, and clipping. The model files used in this program specified vertices and faces, or vertices and Bézier patches.</p>
